# SurpassingLNTradeOffQKD
This repository provides code to reproduce the figures and simulations presented in the paper Surpassing the loss-noise robustness trade-off in quantum key distribution by Hannah Seabrook, Emilien Lavie, Teodor Stroemberg, Matthew P Stafford and Giulia Rubino. The README file outlines which code to use to create each figure.
